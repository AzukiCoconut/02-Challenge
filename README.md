Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge

## Description
This is the solution provided by Matthew Tingley for the UNB Coding Bootcamp Challenge for week 1.  
The purpose of this project was to take an existing website for Horiseon Online Marketing and refactor the code to take into consideration accessibility for people with disabilities.  Accessible websites make it easier for people with diabilities to use assistive technologies such as screen readers, video captions and braille keyboards. 
The following summarizes the changes made to make this site more accessible:
  * Removed <div> tags infavour of more semantic HTML such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, <article> and <footer>
  * Added the alt attribute with descriptive text to give a description of the image that is meaningful to the user using assistive technology
  * Added a more descriptive webpage title in the <head> section.

In addition to converting this website to be more accessible, I also took a run through the HTML code and CSS style classes and performed the following changes:
  * Ensured all links are working, one was identified and corrected
  * Ensured consistancy in use of ID's and Classes.  
  * Added comment text to help future users understand what the code is doing.
  * Consolidated CSS style classes, eliminated many classes and consolidated them under one class based on html semantic
  * Organized CSS style classes match the HTML semantic order in the HTML file.
  * Added commenting to the CSS file to help future users understand what the CSS styles are doing.

I learned proper HTML coding and develop websites with accessibility in mind.  I learned the importance of having an organized CSS file so that one could find styles quickly and easily.  I also learned how to look at someone elses code and find ways to make it better.
